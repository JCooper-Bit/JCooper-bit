## Current Project: *“lars” Rust Crate / Tutorial Series*

I’m immersed in building my **lars** crate + tutorial series
The crate is designed to implement the Linear Algebra concepts I am currently learning as a student into rust to further cement my understanding.
Alongside developing the crate, I am also writing a series of guides to allow other people to follow along and develop their own linear algebra functionality through a series of short tasks. these tasks are designed with modularity in mind, so if for example you only require a 2D vector struct, you can just do those tasks.

As well as mathematical and conceptual explanations, each task has a corresponding solution with full code examples.
